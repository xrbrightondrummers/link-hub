		Welcome! We're a local drumming group, open to everyone.</p>

<image src="../photos/sas2.jpg" width=100%>
<p>
We play at actions and events in support of Extinction Rebellion, and many other causes that align with our ethics and beliefs. If your world-view is based on care, empathy, and the wellbeing of all people, in particular marginalised people, we're probably on the same page.
</p>

<p>
We practice weekly and play samba-inspired music. We learn songs, signs, and breaks shared by a national network of drumming groups, so that we can join forces at larger actions and play together in large numbers.</p>

<p>Our main purpose is to support protests - usually climate-related, but we also support adjacent causes such as the marches for Palestine and Pride, and protests against injustices such as racism, war, arms manufacturing, pollution, excessive energy bills, corporate greed, and more. Our other main purpose is to create a community of like-minded people and have fun playing music every week in our practice sessions - we don't pressure individuals to go to any protests or events.</p>

<p>
No musical talent is necessary, you don't need your own instrument (we have spares), and we often go through things from scratch because we regularly have new people join.<br/><br/>

If you've never been to protests or done anything political before, and if you're generally on the side of progressive, empathetic causes, joining the band can be a safer and more accessible way to actually get out on the streets and do something, without needing to wave placards, shout slogans, or stand in front of traffic (although there are opportunities to do all these things!)<br/><br/>

Our web site has information about how to join, our practice times, dates and locations, and how to get in touch, as well as links to all our social media, videos, and telegram chats.<br/><br/>

Hope to see you at a practice or action soon!<br/><br/>
